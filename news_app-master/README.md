# news_app

A Flutter application for daily update news.

## Overview

This a mobile application that will show the news of the current world. Users can filter news by their needs. They can filter the news by -
  - Category
  - Keyword or phrase
  - Date published 
  - Source domain name
  - Source name
  - Language

I am also adding the recent Corona update section. In this feature users can see the current number of Corona affected, deaths & Recovered patients. Users can Sign In or Sign Up with an easy approach.

## Technology

For this app I am using - 
  - Flutter
  - Firebase 
  
For the state management I am using flutter_bloc. That is a package that help to implement BLoC pattern.
